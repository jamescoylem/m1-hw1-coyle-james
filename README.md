## About Me ##
My name is James and I live in Miami, FL. I am from San Diego and love baseball, coffee, beer, and cooking. I am excited to earn my Master's in mass communication with a specialty in digital strategy this summer.
## Past Coding Experience ##
Sadly, not a whole lot to report on here. The extent of my experience comes from managing a couple of blogs on Squarespace and Wordpress. I have also taken a class or two on HTML, but I'm in major need of a refresher course. 
## Career Goals ##
1. Earn Master's
2. Land remote position as a digital strategist that involves a lot of content writing
3. Work for a advertising or marketing agency as a content or copy writer
4. Develop enough autonomy and freelance contracts to become self-employed
5. Start a digital marketing agency that specializes in local food and beverage businesses 
6. Own and operate a local coffee shop or two
